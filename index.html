      <h2>How FastTrack Jobs works</h2>
      <p>
        FastTrack Jobs gathers job description data from job boards like
        LinkedIn and uses Oauth 2.0 in order to create a google sheet and then
        write the job data into it.
      </p>
      <h2>What personal information is collected?</h2>
      <p>
        None, FastTrack Jobs uses Oauth 2.0 to authorize access to users’ google
        sheets, which means FastTrack Jobs does not collect users’ google
        account credentials.
      </p>
      <h2>How is personal information used?</h2>
      <p>
        According to the Oauth 2.0 Spreadsheets scope: FastTrack Jobs will be
        able to “see, edit create, and delete all of your google spreadsheets”.
        However, the sole purpose of using Oauth 2.0 to access users’ google
        sheets is to write job description information that was copied from job
        boards such as LinkedIn.
      </p>
      <p>
        FastTrack Jobs creates a new google sheet for the user and will
        exclusively work in that sheet only.
      </p>
      <p>FastTrack jobs WILL NOT:</p>
      <ul>
